# Refund System - Business Policy Decision

## 🎯 Overview
After analyzing the technical complexity and business implications, we've implemented a **simple and clean refund policy**:

**✅ Regular Sales**: Can be refunded (items return to inventory)  
**❌ Pre-Order Sales**: Cannot be refunded (sales are final)

## 📋 Why This Approach?

### ✅ **Technical Benefits**
1. **No Foreign Key Issues**: Avoids database constraint violations
2. **Clean Data**: No orphaned or archived variant records
3. **Simple Logic**: Easy to understand and maintain
4. **No Edge Cases**: Eliminates complex pre-order state management

### ✅ **Business Benefits**
1. **Clear Policy**: "Pre-order sales are final" - simple to communicate
2. **Customer Expectations**: Industry standard for pre-orders
3. **Operational Clarity**: No confusion about pre-order status reversals
4. **Inventory Integrity**: Pre-order variants stay in completed state

## 🔧 Implementation

### **UI Changes**
- Pre-order sales show **no refund option** in the actions menu
- Only regular inventory sales can be refunded
- Clear visual indication of pre-order vs regular sales

### **Database Function**
```sql
-- Function explicitly prevents pre-order refunds
IF preorder_items_found > 0 THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot refund sales containing pre-order items. Pre-order sales are final.';
END IF;
```

### **API Response**
- Friendly error message: "Pre-order sales cannot be refunded. Pre-order sales are considered final to maintain business integrity."

## � What Happens

### **Regular Sale Refund** ✅
1. Sale status: `completed` → `refunded`
2. Variant status: `Sold` → `Available`
3. Items return to sellable inventory
4. Excluded from sales statistics
5. Profit distributions removed from calculations

### **Pre-Order Sale Refund** ❌
1. Refund button **hidden** in UI
2. If attempted via API: Error message returned
3. Pre-order remains in `completed` status
4. Variant remains `Sold`
5. Customer must handle returns through other business processes
